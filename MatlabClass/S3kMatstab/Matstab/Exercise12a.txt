1. Run matstab on c13-2.inp include Harmonics
   >> matstab c13-2.inp Harmonics 2

   Note the dr and frequency for the global mode and the regional modes

2. Select shallow control rods (a group of four) to insert and change the rod pattern in c13-2.inp and see what you get.


3. Split the group in 2 and try with the NW-SE pair and the NE-SW pair, and observe the impact.
   Does it make sense?
