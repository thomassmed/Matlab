1. Use the m-file pointk.m to write a Euler forward integration for the case when
the excess reactivity is 80 pcm.
Hint: first find the steady-state solution at time 0 (dy/dt=0), and then write a loop based on Euler forward:

y(i+1)=y(i)+dt*f(t,y)

given that the differential equation system is given by

dy/dt=f(t,y)

Use dt=1ms and simulate for 10 seconds


You may or may not need the following hint(s):
      a) Copy and paste al and b from the file pointk.m to command line so a and b are defined
      b) Define the initial condition y0=[1;b./al]
      c) Check that pointk(y0)=0
      d) Uncomment % raa=0.00080; in pointk.m
      e) define the t-vector  t=0:dt:10;
      f) Preallocate Y=zeros(7,length(t));
      g) Initialize Y(:,1)=y0;
      h) write your loop for i=2:length(t), ...

If nothing happens you probably forgot step g (or d).

2.Write a function Euler('pointk') that computes Euler forward for the point kinetic model

3. Use the function pointkin (in your path) and ode45 to solve the same equation system with 80 pcm excess reatvity 
but now delayed by 2 seconds. Define a function raa=raa_fcn(t) which returns 0 if t<2 and 0.00080 if t>=2.
Also allow for the possibility to vary al and b (beta).
